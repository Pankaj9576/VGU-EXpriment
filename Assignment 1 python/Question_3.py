 Question 3
Describe three different data types commonly used in programming

Ans:=The common data types used in programming include:
- **Integer (int):** An integer is a whole number without any decimal points. It can be positive, negative, or zero.

- **String (str):** A string is a sequence of characters enclosed within single quotes (') or double quotes (").
Strings are used to represent text data.

- **Float (float):** Float is a data type used to represent floating-point numbers, which are numbers that have a decimal point.
Floats are typically used when precision up to a certain number of decimal places is sufficient.

- **Boolean (bool):** A boolean data type has only two possible values: True and False.
Booleans are commonly used for logical comparisons and conditional statements.
